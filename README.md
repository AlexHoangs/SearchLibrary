# SearchLibrary
Created a program to read into a file and search for requested books from a user input.
Utilized and compared linear and binary search to search for requested books and printed out the books foundin the order of ISBN, condition, and language.
Took advantage of the ctime library to time each function to view and compare the run-time of linear and binarysearch in milliseconds.
